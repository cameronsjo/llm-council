# Roadmap Ideas

Feature ideas and improvements for LLM Council.

| Item | Priority | Effort | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Unify Council stages with Arena rounds model | p3 | large | Council uses hardcoded stage1/2/3 while Arena uses flexible rounds[]. Refactor to shared data model: reduces code duplication, enables consistent UI components, easier to add new deliberation patterns. Affects backend storage, API responses, and frontend components. |
